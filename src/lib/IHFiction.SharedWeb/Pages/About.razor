            <p>
                IHeartFiction is a lightweight reading and publishing platform focused on simple, distraction-free
                reading
                and an approachable authoring experience. It started as a personal project and grew into a small tool
                that
                helps authors publish serialized works (single-body stories, multi-chapter stories, and multi-book
                collections) and makes them easy to read on the web.
            </p>

            <h3 class="title is-4 mt-5">A one-person labor of love</h3>
            <p>
                This project is primarily the work of one developer. It's a real labor of love — designed, coded,
                tested,
                and maintained while juggling many other responsibilities. That means things move at my pace, features
                are
                added when I can, and priorities are often guided by feedback from the community.
            </p>

            <article class="notification is-primary">
                <strong>Please know:</strong> this is a grassroots, one-person project. Your support — whether it's
                reporting a bug, suggesting an idea, contributing code, or helping with hosting costs — makes a tangible
                difference.
            </article>

            <h3 class="title is-4 mt-5">Why support?</h3>
            <p>
                Hosting, backups, and third-party services cost money. The more traffic and content the site hosts, the
                higher
                those costs rise. If you enjoy the site and find it useful, please consider supporting the project. Even
                a
                small, recurring contribution helps cover server bills and keeps the project sustainable.

            <h3 class="title is-4 mt-5">How to report bugs, request features, or discuss ideas</h3>
            <p>
                The best place to report bugs or suggest ideas is on GitHub. That keeps everything public, searchable,
                and
                trackable. Please include steps to reproduce, screenshots, and any relevant details. Links:
            </p>

            </ul>

            <div class="notification is-light">
                When opening an issue, please include: a brief summary, reproduction steps, expected vs actual behavior,
                and
                any browser or server logs you can share (redact secrets). If you're proposing a design or workflow
                change,
                a short mock or example use case is extremely helpful.

            <h3 class="title is-4 mt-5">Want to help beyond donating?</h3>
            <p>
                Contributions come in many forms. Here are a few ways you can help:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Report bugs</strong> — file issues with clear steps.</li>
                <li><strong>Share ideas</strong> — start a discussion or propose features.</li>
                <li><strong>Contribute code</strong> — pull requests are welcome. See the repo for contribution
                    guidelines.</li>
                <li><strong>Help with translations</strong> — localizing the UI makes the site accessible to more
                    readers.</li>
                <li><strong>Run a mirror or instance</strong> — self-hosting or sponsoring an instance reduces load on
                    the primary host.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="title is-4 mt-5">Community & Credits</h3>
            <p>
                This project would not exist without feedback from early users and the open-source ecosystem. Thank you
                to
                everyone who reads, tests, and shares the project.
